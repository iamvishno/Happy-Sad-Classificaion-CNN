#  Happy-Sad Emotion Classification Using Deep Learning 

This tool looks at pictures of faces and guesses if the person is happy or sad - just like how you can tell a friend's mood by their smile!  

##  What It Does  
- You **upload a photo** (or take one with your camera)  
- The AI **checks the face** in the photo  
- It tells you if the person looks **happy 😊 or sad 😢**  

##  How the AI Learns  
The AI learned by looking at **few face pictures** that were already labeled as happy or sad. It's like showing a baby many smiley/frowny faces until it learns the difference!  

Key things it notices:  
- Smile lines (lips, eyes)  
- Eyebrow position  
- Face shape changes  

  

## Try It Yourself  
1. Install (just copy-paste this):  
```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python streamlit
```

2. Run the app:  
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Upload any face photo when the browser opens!
